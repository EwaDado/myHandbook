## 1 — Short summary

The video introduces **Google Hacking / Google Dorking** — the use of advanced search operators (Google “dorks”) to locate unintentionally exposed information that has been indexed by search engines. It explains the idea behind the Google Hacking Database (GHDB), demonstrates common operator patterns, shows categories of discoverable items (login pages, exposed files, error messages, open directories, device interfaces), and stresses ethical boundaries and defensive measures. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
A valuable source for known hack is 'Google Dork', reachable under the URL: https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database

## 2 — Key concepts

- **Google Dorks** — advanced search queries that refine results by operator (e.g., `site:`, `filetype:`, `intitle:`, `inurl:`, `intext:`). These allow precise discovery of indexed content. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **GHDB (Google Hacking Database)** — a categorized collection of known, useful dorks maintained for research and defensive testing by the security community. Use GHDB as a reference. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- **Categories of findings** typically include:
  - Exposed files (logs, config files, database dumps)
  - Open directories / backup folders
  - Admin/login panels and exposed web interfaces
  - Error pages revealing server details
  - Publicly accessible device interfaces (e.g., unsecured cameras)
  These categories help structure reconnaissance and triage. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## 3 — High-level (non-actionable) examples

> *Note: examples below are intentionally sanitized / descriptive. Do not use these as “attack recipes.” Use them only to understand what defenders should look for in their own assets.*

- Searching for specific file types that may contain sensitive content (e.g., “files of interest such as `filetype:pdf` or `filetype:log`”);  
- Looking for pages with certain terms in the title (e.g., admin panels): `intitle:"admin"`;  
- Discovering pages with particular URL patterns: `inurl:"/backup/"` or `inurl:"login"`;  
These patterns are the building blocks of dorks — the community organizes them in GHDB. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
